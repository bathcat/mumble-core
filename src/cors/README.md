# Lab: Cors

## Overview

You have been recently tasked with improving an in-house application. Originally written by
interns and a golden retreiver, everything worked ok until you decided to host the client
and API on different ports. It seems weird to everyone.

Your job is to make it work.

Oh and one other thing: security analysts are complaining about a phishing scam that someone is running. 
The bad guys are sending emails to our customers sending them to a fake version of our application. See
if you can prevent the fake application from consuming our API.
